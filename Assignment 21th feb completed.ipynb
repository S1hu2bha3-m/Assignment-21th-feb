    "Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including data mining, data analysis, research, and automation. Some common use cases for web scraping include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market research: Web scraping can be used to collect data on competitors, such as pricing information, product descriptions, and customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis: Web scraping can be used to collect data on social media sites, news sites, and other online sources to perform sentiment analysis, trend analysis, and other types of data analysis.\n",

    "Ans. There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Scraping: Manual scraping involves manually visiting web pages and copying/pasting the desired data into a file or spreadsheet. This method is time-consuming and not suitable for scraping large amounts of data, but it can be useful for small-scale scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML parsing: HTML parsing involves using a programming language to parse the HTML code of a web page and extract the desired data. This method is more efficient than manual scraping and can be used to extract large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping tools and libraries: There are many web scraping tools and libraries available that automate the scraping process, making it easier to extract data from websites. Some popular web scraping tools and libraries include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow users to access their data in a structured format. This method is often more efficient and reliable than web scraping, but it requires knowledge of API programming and may be limited by the availability of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser extensions: Browser extensions, such as Web Scraper or Data Miner, can be used to extract data from web pages without writing any code. These extensions allow users to visually select the data they want to extract and export it in a structured format."
